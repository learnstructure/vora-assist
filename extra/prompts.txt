So far everything's working. Can you make these updates?
1. Right now the screen has very dark theme. Can you make it slightly dark bluish theme?
2. In my android phone, for the chat page, some portion of the input field (bottom part where user writes prompt) is not visible (may be due to Android's buttons at bottom of the screen). Can you improve it? 
3. Right now, the input filed in chat page shows as one liner while chatting. Can you make it bigger like in professional apps like gemini or chatGPT?
4. RIght now the code generated by the models are properly displayed. But can you add feature to copy the code block generated?
5. When there is no document in the memory, the big block showing "Memory is empty" shows up. I think it would be better if we could add drop feature to upload files.
Rest of the logic is working fine.


Perfect. Still needs these changes:
1. There is very high contrast in the texts generated by the models. Please improve that.
2. I think it would be better to change the name from "Expert 120B" to actual model name "GPT OSS 120B". If you think so too, please change the name.
3. Can you add option in the input field of chat page so that the user can press enter to change line?

Please make these changes:
1. Remove the "Enter to send" option. I want by default the "Enter" key to be line changing key. 
2. Also the placeholder says "Cmd+Enter to send". But this should be "Ctrl+Enter to send". Am I right?
3. And remove this placeholder from the mobile device
4. Bold letters still look very high contrast in the UI. Please improve that as well.

I like everything now. Can you just improve the theme of the block showing message generated like in this attached image (or similar).

What about images? Can they be parsed by the current setup I have? Please do not change any code now. Just give me suggestions.

Can you explain in detail how the tech works now? When I upload files in the memory bank, the texts are extracted and gemini api does something to convert to vector database? Are these embeddings stored in the browser so parsing does not occur everytime? Please forgive me for my use of words as I am new to these techs. Use proper technical terms and explain the whole process in detail. Do not change any code at this moment.

So in total, gemini API is being used thrice here in following ways:
1. Once during uploading document in the memory bank
2. Every time user types message, the message is converted to vector by Gemini api
3. Finally the augemented prompt is sent to LLMs (gemini, llama, etc.)
Or the second process is done in the browser itself?

Now I want to improve "Identity" or Profile Editor page. I feel like the models are not able to see all the details, especially "Partner context (Bio)" portion of the identity. Can you update this page properly? Make these changes:
1. Replace "Legal Name / Moniker" by "Name"
2. Replace "Partner Context (Bio)" to just "Bio" or "Goals". The LLMs are not seeing contents of this portion right now. Fix this.

Also make these changes:
1. There is a text "CTRL+ENTER TO SEND" at the bottom of input field on the chat page. Please remove that.
2. The app now works perfect for PCs and android phones. But there is still an issue in IPAD. In my IPad in chat page, sometimes the icon to bring the sidebar gets hidden to the top and sometimes the input gets hidden to the bottom
